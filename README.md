# Express Middleware

Guided project for **Node API 3** module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and learn to use and create `Express Middleware`.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned the **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm install` to download dependencies.

Please follow along as the instructor creates and adds `middleware` to the API step by step.

## Lecture Notes

### Four types of middleware
- Built-in middleware: functions that come with Express
- Third-party middleware: functions that we install through NPM
- Custom middleware: functions that we write ourselves
- Error middleware: functions that catch errors in the middleware stack
